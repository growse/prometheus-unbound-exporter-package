# Prometheus unbound exporter - deb package

![Github Action status](https://github.com/growse/prometheus-unbound-exporter-package/workflows/Build%2C%20package%20and%20deploy/badge.svg)

I needed a deb file for the Prometheus unbound exporter binary, so I made this. Result gets put onto apt.growse.com.

```
deb http://apt.growse.com/ stable main
```
